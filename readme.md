# Coupled NMF and Logistic Regression

This small Python library implements a coupled matrix factorization model with Logistic Regression.
Intuitively, the model performs simultaneous sparse feature extraction (as with Nonnegative Matrix
Factorization) and binary classification (with Logistic Regression).
